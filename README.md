👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Arnab – a machine learning engineer and systems developer specializing in Generative AI, LLM development, and OS kernel-level engineering with a focus on post-quantum security.
🔍 Current Focus

Exploring cutting-edge techniques in generative models and prompt engineering
Building and fine-tuning large language models for real-world applications
Experimenting with hyperparameter optimization and model performance tuning

💻 Technical Expertise
OS Kernel Development

Custom kernel development and optimization for both SBC (Single Board Computers) and x86 architectures
Low-level systems design, performance optimization, and hardware-software integration

Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Implementation

Kernel-level integration of CRYSTALS-Dilithium (NIST-standardized digital signature algorithm)
Experience with lattice-based cryptographic primitives resistant to quantum attacks
Implementation of NIST PQC standards including:

Dilithium (ML-DSA) for digital signatures
Kyber (ML-KEM) for key encapsulation mechanisms
SPHINCS+ (SLH-DSA) for hash-based signatures


Performance optimization of PQC algorithms for resource-constrained embedded systems
Integration of quantum-resistant cryptography into secure boot chains and trusted execution environments

🤝 Open to Collaboration
I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on:

Hyperparameter optimization techniques
Deep learning model development and architecture design
LLM fine-tuning and deployment strategies
Kernel-level security implementations and PQC integration
Post-quantum cryptographic protocol design and optimization
Custom OS solutions for embedded systems and specialized hardware
Security-focused systems programming projects
