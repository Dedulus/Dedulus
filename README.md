## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Arnab** — a **systems security engineer** working at the intersection of **AI evaluation, sandboxed execution, and secure infrastructure**. My work focuses on building **production grade safety controls** for environments where untrusted or model generated code must be executed under strict security boundaries.

I have **10 years of experience** across enterprise systems, utility platforms, cloud environments, and AI safety tooling, with a strong emphasis on **policy enforced execution, runtime observability, and secure inter process communication**.

I am an **active open source contributor**, with merged contributions to **Inspect AI (UK Government / AISI)** and ongoing work across **LLM runtime safety ecosystems**.

## 🔍 Current Focus

- Secure execution environments for **AI evaluation and red teaming**
- Policy enforced sandboxing and isolation for **model generated code**
- Runtime safety and observability for **LLM serving systems**
- Post Quantum Cryptography applied to **real world IPC and infrastructure**
- Maintainer friendly, opt in security extensions for **open source projects**
