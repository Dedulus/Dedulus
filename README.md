👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Arnab — a systems security engineer working at the intersection of AI evaluation, sandboxed execution, and secure infrastructure. My work focuses on building production grade safety controls for environments where untrusted or model generated code must be executed under strict security boundaries.

I have 10 years of experience across enterprise systems, utility platforms, cloud environments, and AI safety tooling, with a strong emphasis on policy enforced execution, runtime observability, and secure inter process communication.

I am an active open source contributor, with merged contributions to Inspect AI (UK Government / AISI) and ongoing work across LLM runtime safety ecosystems.

🔍 Current Focus

Secure execution environments for AI evaluation and red teaming

Policy enforced sandboxing and isolation for model generated code

Runtime safety and observability for LLM serving systems

Post Quantum Cryptography applied to real world IPC and infrastructure

Maintainer friendly, opt in security extensions for OSS projects
